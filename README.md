# Twitter-Sentiment-analysis_Django_UI
“Twitter Sentiment Analysis” is a data mining and machine learning project developed as part of the IOE major project curriculum. It uses a Naive Bayes classifier for supervised learning to analyze and classify tweets as positive or negative based on labeled training data. With millions of tweets shared daily, this system helps categorize public opinions at scale. The project also included an analysis and comparison of tweets from different users to draw meaningful insights from their sentiments.
